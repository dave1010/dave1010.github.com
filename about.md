I'm technical lead at [Base](http://wearebase.com), a digital agency in Westbourne, near Bournemouth. Leading the development team, I'm responsible for the technical output and quality. Much of my time is spent doing system architecture/integration and working with modern open source frameworks.

If my fingers are near a keyboard then chances are I'm writing PHP or JavaScript. You can see a fraction of what I code on [GitHub](https://github.com/dave1010).

I'm also one of the cofounders of [PHP Dorset](http://www.phpdorset.co.uk).

I have a gmail.com email address, that starts with dave1010.

Specialties: PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, Linux, Security, Performance, Open Source.

Experience: Mobile web apps, jQuery, CSS, RWD, Sass, accessibility, usability, Apache, Nginx, PostgreSQL, Bash, HTML, HTML5, HTML6, Unit testing, TDD, Symfony, Laravel, big data, graph databases, pen testing.

This site is Open Source! [Pull requests](https://github.com/dave1010/dave1010.github.io) welcome.
